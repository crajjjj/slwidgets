Incompatible mods:

Affected indirectly by mods that impact iWant Widgets.  Mods significantly altering hudmenu.gfx directly or via a hudmenu.swf file may prevent image display.  SkyHUD has been confirmed to cause this behavior.


Customization:

You can use your own icons. To do that put them into \Interface\exported\widgets\iwant\widgets\library\.. folders. Just follow the naming convention already in place.

Supported icon format is .dds. To convert you can use Gimp (pick bc3 compression/no mipmaps when exporting to dds)

Notes on LE compatibility:
LE version of the iWant Status Bars/iWant Widgets is included in the fomod of the SE version.
